## Story
I'm not native english speaker, I can not 'read' if a tweet or a sentence is sarcastic or not.  

So I `<sarcasm>`tweeted  about it`</sarcasm>` and got some traction (fav, RT) and replies. Best reply was from [@ftrain](https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/625713179138637824) with link to W3C Recommendation on emotional tag. 

As part of [@sfpc](https://twitter.com/sfpc) "poetry machine" session, I made little widget to show random gif annimation related keyword "sarcasm".

## Side Note
lol this code is ~so untidy~ I only had about 30 min or so ... so I don't care.
